## Labeling / annotations
1. labeling a set of cells at once
1. modify label before assigning
1. for the "labeling suggestions" part -- my guess is that these are neurons that have been tentatively identified but need confirmation? if this is the case 
   id suggest 1) adding some instructions, 2) before allowing a user to accept/reject things, to validate somehow that they are a user that can do so 
   (the way we had the flywire training before being allowed to actually make changes in the dataset)-- i was tempted to click around and click 
   "accept" to see what happens, but didnt because i wasnt sure if this would change something in the dataset or what it was doing
1. I also wonder how viable it is to put a neuroglancer window in Labelling Suggestions , because itâ€™s time consuming to
   compare many cells when you have to load a neuroglancer link for every pair of neruons
1. And perhaps labelling suggestions could also allow you to put multiple pairs at the same time into a neuroglancer window quickly
