## Search / cell lists
1. select with checkboxes what is shown in 3d interactive image, so that its easy to compare morphologies by eye

## Labels / data quality
1. import Hemibrain and other labels/annotations

## Pathways / NBLAST tables
1. after nblast, people might want to look at a subset (but more than 2 neurons) together. Perhaps a checkbox to select ids to copy would be useful?
1. origin / target textboxes instead of just one with set of cells

## General TODO:
1. use synapse position partition into smaller cubes (instead neuropils) for similarity metric
1. inspect diff from best match to 2nd best match to identify quality
1. provide forward vs symmetric nblast scores
1. account history
1. input/output combined piechart in cell details page
1. programmatic access with user tokens
1. user starred cells
1. look up previous cell root ids by coordinates
