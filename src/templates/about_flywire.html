        <h6>Data Sources</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Cell segments were auto-generated from electron-microscopy images with AI</li>
            <li>Cell reconstructions were assembled from segments (proofread) by the FlyWire community (see <a href="https://flywire.ai" target="_blank">FlyWire</a>)</li>
            <li>Synaptic connections were automatically detected using the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01183-7">Buhmann et al.</a> method</li>
            <li>Free-form labels (cell identification tags) were provided by the FlyWire community - see the <a href="{{url_for('app.leaderboard')}}">labeling leaderboard</a> and detailed credits in each cell info page</li>
            <li>Hierarchical annotations (side, flow, super class, cell class, cell type, Hemibrain type, nerve and hemi-lineage) were provided by Schlegel et al. (Jefferis lab)</li>
            <li>Neurotransmitter types were predicted by <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.148775v2">Eckstein, Bates et al.</a></li>
            <li>Morphological similarity scores (NBLAST based) were computed for the central brain cells by Philipp Schlegel</li>
